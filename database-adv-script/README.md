# SQL Join Queries - Airbnb Clone

This project demonstrates mastery of SQL joins by writing complex queries using different types of joins.

## Files

- `joins_queries.sql` - Contains SQL queries for INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and FULL OUTER JOIN.
- `README.md` - This file.

## Queries

1. **INNER JOIN**
   - Retrieves all bookings and the users who made those bookings.

2. **LEFT JOIN**
   - Retrieves all properties and their reviews, including properties with no reviews.

3. **FULL OUTER JOIN**
   - Retrieves all users and all bookings, even if there is no matching record between them.
   - A workaround is provided for MySQL (which does not support FULL OUTER JOIN natively).
